Bug fixes
#########

* Fix file extension check to dump a graph correctly as .graphml-file
* The full constraint set of the ExtractionTurbineCHP class was only build for

 was missing. This leads to wrong results.
* In the solph constraints module the emission constraint did not include
  the timeincrement form the model which has now be fixed.
